# Reverse Job Search

Reverse Job Search is an AI-powered career matchmaking platform that automates and enhances the job discovery process. Instead of requiring users to search manually through job boards, the system intelligently analyzes uploaded resumes and recommends the most relevant job opportunities based on skills, experience, and preferences.

## Overview

This platform uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to:

- Parse resumes and extract structured candidate data
- Suggest job roles based on technical background and experience
- Fetch live job listings from the Adzuna API using suggested roles
- Rank jobs by semantic similarity between resume content and job descriptions

It is built using Python with the Flask framework and integrates AI capabilities through OpenAIâ€™s DeepSeek API and HuggingFace transformer models.

## Key Features

- Resume analysis using AI to extract skills, experience, and projects
- Role suggestions based on the candidate's technical profile
- Real-time job fetching from Adzuna API
- Job ranking using sentence-transformer-based semantic similarity
- Location and experience-based filtering
- Secure authentication system with Flask-Login
- Clean, responsive UI with paginated job listings

## API Setup

This application uses Firebase and external APIs for backend services.

1. DeepSeek API:  
   - You must have 2 DeepSeek API keys.  
   - Open utils.py and replace placeholder keys with your real keys in the line:  
     api_keys = ["<YOUR_FIRST_KEY>", "<YOUR_SECOND_KEY>"]

2. Adzuna API:  
   - Sign up at https://developer.adzuna.com/  
   - Add your APP_ID and APP_KEY in utils.py.

3. Generate Service Account Credentials:  
   - Go to  Project Settings > Service Accounts

   - Save it as serviceAccountKey.json in the project root directory (/reverse-job-search/serviceAccountKey.json)

4. Running the Application:  
   - Make sure the virtual environment is activated, then run:  
     python run.py  
   - The app will launch and be accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
